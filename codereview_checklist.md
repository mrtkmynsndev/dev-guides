# Code Review Checklist

## Readability and Maintainability

**Purpose:** Enhances code maintainability and collaboration by ensuring a consistent and readable codebase.

- Code follows project coding style and conventions.
- Variable and function names are meaningful.
- Code is easy to read and understand.
- Consistent indentation and formatting.

```go
// Readability and Maintainability
func main() {
	// Function with meaningful name
	result := divide(5, 10)
	fmt.Println(result)
}

func divide(a, b int) (int, err) {
	if b == 0 {
		return errors.New("Division by zero is not allowed.")
	}
	return a / b
}
```

## Functionality and Correctness

**Purpose:** Verifies that the code behaves as expected, handles errors correctly, and meets project requirements.
